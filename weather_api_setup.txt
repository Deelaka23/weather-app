## 1. Install the `requests` library

Make sure you have Python installed. Then open your terminal or command prompt and run:
'''
pip install requests
```


## 2. Get an API Key from OpenWeatherMap

1. Go to https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Click on "Sign Up" (or "Sign In" if you already have an account)
3. After logging in, go to https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
4. Copy the API key listed there


## 3. Inputs Required

- **City Name**: You will be asked to enter a city name to check the weather (e.g., "Colombo", "New York").
- **API Key**: Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key.


## 4. Sample API Request (in code)

```python
import requests

city_name = "London"
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your API key

response = requests.get(f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city_name}&appid={api_key}&units=metric")
data = response.json()

print(data)
```
